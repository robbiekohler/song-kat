**Tonic (I)**: The home chord. Creates a sense of resolution and stability.

**Subdominant (IV)**: Creates tension that wants to move. Often leads to the dominant or back to tonic.

**Dominant (V)**: Maximum tension. Strongly pulls back to the tonic for resolution.

The most basic progression: I → IV → V → I follows this tension-release pattern.

    title: 'Relative Minor',
    content: `
Every major key has a relative minor that shares all the same notes.

The relative minor is the 6th degree of the major scale:
- C major → A minor
- G major → E minor
- D major → B minor

This is why vi chords (like Am in C major) sound so natural in pop progressions.

    title: 'Borrowed Chords',
    content: `
Borrowed chords come from the parallel minor key and add emotional depth:

- **iv (minor)**: The minor 4 chord adds melancholy (I-IV-iv-I)
- **bVII**: From Mixolydian mode, common in rock (I-bVII-IV)
- **bVI**: Creates a dramatic, cinematic sound
- **bIII**: Often used in folk and rock progressions

These add color without fully leaving your key.

    title: 'Why Certain Progressions Work',
    content: `
**I-V-vi-IV**: Starts strong, peaks with the dominant, then the vi adds emotion before IV sets up the return.

**vi-IV-I-V**: Starting on the minor creates tension that resolves beautifully when the I arrives.

**ii-V-I**: The ii chord is a softer approach to the dominant, creating smoother jazz voice leading.

Most hit songs use just these few progressions - it's what you do with melody and rhythm that makes them unique!

Voice leading is how individual notes move between chords:

- **Common tones**: Keep notes that appear in both chords
- **Step motion**: Move other notes by the smallest interval
- **Contrary motion**: Bass moves opposite to melody

Good voice leading makes progressions feel smooth and connected.

Example: C to Am
- C: C-E-G
- Am: A-C-E
- C and E are common tones, only G moves to A (one step)

The circle of fifths shows relationships between keys:

**Moving clockwise** (up a 5th): G → D → A → E → B
**Moving counter-clockwise** (up a 4th): C → F → Bb → Eb → Ab

Why it matters:
- Adjacent keys share 6 of 7 notes (easy key changes)
- ii-V-I moves counter-clockwise (Dm → G → C)
- Most pop songs stay within 2-3 adjacent keys

Understanding this helps you see why certain chord changes sound natural.

Modes are scales built on different degrees of the major scale, each with a unique sound:

- **Ionian (I)**: Standard major, bright and happy
- **Dorian (ii)**: Minor with a raised 6th, jazzy/sophisticated
- **Phrygian (iii)**: Minor with flat 2nd, Spanish/exotic
- **Lydian (IV)**: Major with raised 4th, dreamy/floating
- **Mixolydian (V)**: Major with flat 7th, bluesy/rock
- **Aeolian (vi)**: Natural minor, sad/serious
- **Locrian (vii)**: Diminished feel, rarely used

Try using bVII in your major key - instant Mixolydian rock sound!

    title: 'Chord Extensions',

Adding notes beyond the basic triad creates richer sounds:

- **7th chords**: Add the 7th note (Cmaj7, Dm7, G7)
- **9th chords**: Add the 9th for color (Cmaj9, Am9)
- **sus chords**: Replace 3rd with 4th or 2nd (Csus4, Dsus2)
- **add chords**: Add a note without removing others (Cadd9)

Jazz uses lots of extensions. Pop often uses sus2/sus4 for atmosphere.

The dominant 7th (G7 in key of C) creates extra tension that strongly wants to resolve.

    title: 'Vocal Harmony Basics',
    content: `
Vocal harmony is singing different notes that complement the melody. Here's how to get started:

**The Simplest Harmonies**
- **3rds above**: Sing 3 scale steps above the melody (most common in pop/rock)
- **3rds below**: Sing 3 scale steps below (creates a warmer sound)
- **6ths**: Singing a 6th above sounds like a 3rd below (they're inversions)

**Finding Your Harmony Note**
When the melody lands on a chord tone, harmonize with another chord tone:
- Melody on Root → Harmony on 3rd or 5th
- Melody on 3rd → Harmony on Root or 5th
- Melody on 5th → Harmony on Root or 3rd

**The "Above or Below" Rule**
If harmonizing in 3rds above, stay above the whole phrase. Don't jump around - consistency creates blend.

**Common Harmony Intervals**

- **Major/Minor 3rds**: The sweet spot for pop harmony (Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel)
- **Perfect 5ths**: Open, powerful sound (medieval music, power ballads)
- **Perfect 4ths**: Strong, bright, almost aggressive
- **6ths**: Warm and rich (inverted 3rds)
- **Octaves**: Same note, different pitch - adds power without complexity

**Parallel vs. Contrary Motion**
- **Parallel**: Both voices move same direction (3rds throughout)
- **Contrary**: Voices move opposite directions (more sophisticated)
- **Oblique**: One voice stays still, one moves

**When to Change Intervals**
Don't be locked into always singing 3rds. Sometimes a 4th or 5th sounds better - let your ear guide you. The harmony should follow the chord tones.

    title: 'Practicing Vocal Harmony',
    content: `
**Step-by-Step Practice Method**

1. **Learn the melody cold**: You can't harmonize what you don't know
2. **Identify the chords**: Write out which chord plays under each melody note
3. **Find chord tones**: Pick harmony notes that are IN the current chord
4. **Sing very slowly**: Speed reveals mistakes
5. **Record yourself**: Your phone is your best teacher

**Exercises for Couples/Duos**

- One person holds a single note, other sings scales against it
- Trade melody/harmony parts each verse
- Sing songs you both know - one takes high, one takes low
- Start with songs that already have famous harmonies (Beatles, Fleet Foxes)

**Blending Tips**
- Match vowel shapes exactly
- Breathe at the same spots
- The harmony should be slightly quieter than melody
- Listen MORE than you sing

**How Harmony Notes Relate to Chords**

When a C major chord (C-E-G) is playing:
- If melody is on C, try harmonizing on E or G
- If melody is on E, try C or G
- If melody is on G, try C or E

**Non-Chord Tones in Melody**
When the melody hits a passing tone (not in the chord):
- Option 1: Harmonize it anyway (risky but can sound cool)
- Option 2: Hold your previous note until melody returns to a chord tone
- Option 3: Move to the nearest chord tone

**Creating Tension and Release**
Dissonant harmonies (2nds, 7ths) create tension that resolves to consonance (3rds, 5ths, 6ths). Use this for emotional impact at key lyrics.

**Tip for Finding Harmonies**
Play the chord on guitar/piano, sing the melody, then pick a different chord tone to sing. It will always work!

**Study These Artists**

- **The Beatles**: Primarily 3rds and 6ths, sometimes unison for power
- **Simon & Garfunkel**: Tight 3rds, incredible blend
- **Fleet Foxes**: Stacked harmonies, multiple parts, folk/baroque style
- **Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young**: Three-part harmonies, each voice distinct
- **The Everly Brothers**: The template for rock vocal harmony
- **First Aid Kit**: Modern folk harmony excellence

**Three-Part Harmony Basics**
- Lead melody in the middle
- High harmony (typically 3rd or 5th above)
- Low harmony (3rd below, or bass notes/root)

**Country/Bluegrass Stack**
- High lonesome: Tight harmonies, tenor above lead
- "Brother duet" style: Two voices in very tight 3rds

**Gospel/R&B**
- More movement, voices weave around each other
- Use of 7ths and suspensions
- Call and response between lead and harmonies
